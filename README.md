# Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This repository consists of the machine learning algorithm developing from scratch which are a part of the FIT5201 assignments (All of the code in jupyter notebooks is produce with R coding language).
These are all algorithms including the following:
1. KNN regression
2. KNN regression with k-fold cross-validation
3. Bootstrap with KNN regression
4. Ridge regression on SGD and BGD
5. Multicalss Perceptron
6. Bayasian Classifier vs Logistic Regression
7. Expectation-Maximization on document clustering
8. Neural Network vs Perceptron
9.
